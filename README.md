A web app that helps skiers find their way in a ski resort

***IMPORTANT***

to run this app, the server must be run then the client. If Node js and npm are installed. The steps are as follows:

1- acess the server directory using the OS terminal and run npm run dev.
2- access the client directory using a new OS terminal and run npm start.

** Eclipse has issues with loading ES6 modules. Working on that for the second iteration. **
